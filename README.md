Flxbl aspires to serve as a hub for all open-source solutions that enhance the quality of Salesforce implementations, regardless of size.

**flxbl** complements the Salesforce Well-Architected Framework by providing a practical implementation roadmap tailored to Salesforce development teams. While the Well-Architected Framework outlines the principles and best practices for building robust, efficient, and secure Salesforce solutions, flxbl offers the tools and methodologies to put these principles into action. It bridges the gap between theoretical guidance and practical application, ensuring that teams not only understand what constitutes a well-architected Salesforce solution, but also have the means to achieve it through efficient DevOps practices and collaborative workflows.
